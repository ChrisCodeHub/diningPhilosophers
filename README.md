# diningPhilosophers
This is a sandpit to look into the dining philosophers problem, since its a classic.  Just coded for fun and to learn, its probably not the best solution

nice descriptions of this problem abound on the web, in a nutshell 

Imagine that there are five philosophers.  They spend their lives just thinking and eating. In the middle of the dining room is a circular table with five chairs. The table has a big plate of spaghetti in the middle. There are only _five_ chopsticks available. Each philosopher thinks, then when they get hungry, picks up the two chopsticks that are closest to them. If a philosopher can pick up both chopsticks, they eat awhile. After eating, the chopsticks are put down and another phase of thinking begins.

- There is no limit to the amount of spaghetti
- There is no limit to the appetite
- Philosophers eat at different speeds
- They need to have both chopsticks to eat

- no Philospher must starve....
  
problem was (I think) attributed to Djikstra as an example in threaded programming
